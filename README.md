# The Ritual

A quiet, intentional space for focused work.

The Ritual is a minimal timer and task surface designed to be opened,
used briefly, and then forgotten while you work.

No accounts.
No analytics.
No streaks.
No pressure.

Just clarity.

## Philosophy

This is not a productivity tool.
It is a ritual.

The goal is not to do more —
but to decide what matters, commit, and stop on time.

---

## How I Use It

1. Open The Ritual in a new tab
2. Set a duration
3. Choose a small number of tasks
4. Start
5. Close the tab and work

When the session ends, I stop.
